## About
 An app for domestic violence victims to easily get help from the responsible organisations incase of danger.

## Built With 🛠
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [In-app Updates](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates) - Lets the app download updates seemlessly with out interrupting the user experince with the app.

## TODO
- Add the organisations functionality once we are partnered up.
- Use DI to handle dependecies and make the app very scalable and testable.
- Add in-app updates to the app.
- etc...
